## Example

[NerdWallet's Retirement Calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator) is a brilliant example of a retirement calculator (though you can find tons more on Google).

## Description

Create a web application composed of four input fields:

1. User age
2. Pre-tax income

Using these inputs, display how much money a user will need to retire at 67 years old assuming a 6.0% savings rate.
