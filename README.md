# Retirement Calculator

This project will help build proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Example

[NerdWallet's Retirement Calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator) is a brilliant example of a retirement calculator (though you can find tons more on Google).

## Description

Create a web application composed of four input fields:

1. User age
2. Pre-tax income
3. Current savings
4. Monthly savings

Using these inputs, display how much money a user will need to retire at 67 years old assuming a 6.0% savings rate.

## Project Set Up

1. Click the green "Use this template" button
2. Create a new repository
3. At the command line, clone your new repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git` (note the need to replace the URL with your URL!)
4. `cd your-repository-name`
5. `npm install`
6. `npm start`
7. Go to http://localhost:8080

## Tips and Gotchas

1. Don't know how to calculate when someone will retire? Leverage the power of Google to find the formula!
2. Unsure what a retirement calculator should look like? Use Google to find [some inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?q=retirement+calculator)!

## Bonus
