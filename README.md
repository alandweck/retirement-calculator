# Retirement Calculator

This project will help build proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Example

[NerdWallet's Retirement Calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator) is a brilliant example of a retirement calculator (though you can find tons more on Google).

## Description

Create a web application composed of four input fields:

1. User age
2. Pre-tax income
3. Current savings
4. Monthly savings

Using these inputs, display how much money a user will need to retire at 67 years old assuming a 6.0% savings rate.

## Project Set Up

1. Create a Github account if you don't have one already. 
2. Download VS Code if you haven't already. Link here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. Fork this repository by clicking the button "fork" in the upper right. 
4. Copy the URL of the new repository by clicking the green "Click or download" button in your repository and clicking the copy icon.
5.  Create a new folder where you want to store this project. You can call it something like "Coding" or "ProjectCamp".
6.  Go to your computers terminal application by typing "terminal" in your copmuters search.  At the command line, navigate to the folder by using the "cd" command. For example: "cd desktop", "cd projectcamp" 
7. Once you are at your desired folder location, clone your new repository by typing `git clone {paste the URL here}`
8. type `cd retirement-calculator`
9. type `npm install` to retrieve all the dependencies. 
10. type `npm start` to start the server
11. Go to http://localhost:8080 - you should see a white page with "Hello World"
12. Open up VS code and click "open". Select the "rectirement-calculator" folder to open up all the files.

## Other Important Information

### Support
One of our principles is “Embrace the Struggle”. What this means to us is that the way you get better at coding is by struggling through problems. If you’re not struggling, you’re probably not learning. When you struggle through a problem, you’re going through steps that will result in you understanding the problem better than if you didn’t struggle with it.
Because of this, we ask you that you work on a problem for at least 20 minutes before seeking support. When you do need support, fill out this form:
https://forms.gle/PLpYJC2vNAGmpDXk9
As soon as you fill it out, Scott or Aryan will DM you on Discord to help you out. 

### Timing
We ask that you complete the project no later than Sunday, June 7th. If you don’t think you’ll be able to meet this deadline, please reach out to Scott and Aryan and we will work with you to figure out an alternate plan.

### Feedback Form
After getting your code review, we ask that you fill out a feedback form that will allow us to improve. We really appreciate as much feedback as you can provide.
